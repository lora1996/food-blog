                    <h2> Has fast food become worse for our health in the past 30 years?</h2>

                        <p>Filled with empty calories and ultra-processed, fast food may increase the risk of obesity
                            and cancer. While fast-food chains have ostensibly been trying to offer more healthful
                            options, a new study finds that the health impact of their menus has not improved — to the
                            contrary, in fact.
                            Data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) indicate that, between 2013
                            and 2016, 36.6 percentTrusted Source of adults in the United States ate fast food on any
                            given day.
                            Moreover, according to a study conducted by University of Connecticut researchers in 2018,
                            around 74 percent of parents purchase unhealthful foods for their children in fast-food
                            restaurants.
                            This, the investigators noted, is despite the fact that, from 2013 onward, some of the most
                            popular fast-food chains committed to offering more healthful options in their children's
                            menus.
                            Now, a new study suggests that most fast-food restaurant menus have not, in fact, become
                            more healthful overall, despite the addition of some arguably more wholesome choices.
                            The researchers analyzed the variety, portion size, and nutrition of entrées, sides, and
                            desserts offered by 10 of the most popular fast-food chains in the U.S. over a period of
                            roughly 3 decades, based on the menus they made available at three points in time: in 1986,
                            1991, and 2016.
                            The team analyzed menus from: Arby's, Burger King, Carl's Jr., Dairy Queen, Hardee's, Jack
                            in the Box, KFC, Long John Silver's, McDonald's, and Wendy's.
                            In the study paper — which appears in the Journal of the Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics
                            — the investigators explain their focus, noting that, "These restaurants were chosen because
                            the nutritional information on the key nutritional variables of portion size, energy, and
                            sodium were available for each of the 3 years being analyzed."
                            "Given the popularity of fast food, our study highlights one of the changes in our food
                            environment that is likely part of the reason for the increase in obesity and related
                            chronic conditions over the past several decades, which are now among the main causes of
                            death in the U.S.," says lead investigator Megan McCrory, Ph.D.
                            Fast food still fuels chronic conditions
                            The researchers looked at how entrées, sides, and desserts changed on these fast-food
                            restaurants' menus over the 30-year span.
                            More specifically, they paid attention to changes in caloric content, portion size, energy
                            density, and sodium, iron, and calcium contents.
                            McCrory, an associate professor at Boston University in Massachusetts, and the team accessed
                            the relevant data through The Fast-Food Guide, which was published in 1986 and 1991, and via
                            resources available online for the year 2016.

                            First, the researchers observed that the variety of foods that these restaurants offered
                            increased at a high rate of 22.9 items, or 226 percent, per year.
                            However, as the variety increased, so did the caloric content of the food items on offer, as
                            did portion size.
                            Thus, among entrées, sides, and desserts, calories saw a sharp increase. The largest such
                            rise was in the dessert category, with an increase of 62 kilocalories every 10 years. Next
                            came entrées, which saw an increase of 30 kilocalories per decade.
                            The team found a link between higher caloric content and larger portion sizes. These
                            increased by 13 grams per decade for entrées and 24 grams per decade for desserts. At the
                            same time, sodium (salt) content also went up among each food type.
                            "Our study offers some insights on how fast food may be helping to fuel the continuing
                            problem of obesity and related chronic conditions," the lead researcher concludes, adding:
                            "Despite the vast number of choices offered at fast-food restaurants, some of which are
                            healthier than others, the calories, portion sizes, and sodium content overall have worsened
                            (increased) over time and remain high."
                            Megan McCrory, Ph.D.
                            A long way to go for fast-food chains
                            McCrory and the team also note that four of the 10 fast-food chains also provided
                            information on the calcium and iron contents of items on their menus over the past 3
                            decades.
                            The researchers acknowledge that the two essential nutrients — which play key roles in bone
                            and blood health — are much more present in fast food now than they were 30 years ago.
                            Specifically, entrées and desserts now have significantly higher calcium contents, and iron
                            is more abundant in desserts.
                            However, McCrory stresses that fast food should not be the first port of call for people
                            looking to increase their calcium and iron levels, since these nutrients are available in
                            unprocessed or minimally processed foods, such as seeds, dairy products, and fish.
                            "We need to find better ways to help people consume fewer calories and sodium at fast-food
                            restaurants," says McCrory.
                            "The requirement that chain restaurants display calories on their menus is a start. We would
                            like to see more changes, such as restaurants offering smaller portions at [...]
                            proportional prices," she adds.
